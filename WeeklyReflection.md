# Weekly Reflection

### Weeks 2-3 (9/2 - 9/13)
With this being the last project for before graduation, I really want to choose something different that what was 
built in previous semesters. My instructor suggested https://rapidapi.com/hub and finally i found some inspiration! We 
will be exploring the use of API's this semester so choosing to combine the use of sports and AI options for my project
was a no-brainer! Using sports and A.I., i want to predict the outcome of a game!  Belieive it or not, that was my 
biggest struggle and set me back a bit but i'm excited to move on now. I worry that the scope is a little more than
i expected and hope i'm not in over my head with the given timeframe and my skill level.

Completed - (4 hours)
 * Choose project idea
 * Create repo
 * Tomcat configured
 * Favorite the API's i'd like to use from https://rapidapi.com/hub and other sites like it
 * Name, repo link, and project topic added to student directory

### Week 4 (9/16) (5 hours)
Played a bit of catch up this week with the project and course work. Our first checkpoint is due this week so 
that will be my priority before looking into this week's topic. After my project plan was done, i really wanted to get
the index page and some other placeholder's started and pick one of the easier user stories to start with. Ended up 
choosing Bootsrap as the framework for my project since that is what i'm most familiar with. Imported a theme from
w3schools.com from last semester that i liked as well. I struggled a little with the project plan trying to predict
what i'd be working but i had to keep in mind things change so it does not have to perfect.

Completed - 
 * Project Plan 
 * MVP user stories
 * README.md updated
 * Imported Bootstrap
 * Index.jsp page started
 * Theme included 
 * Renamed Repo
