# Sports Performance Predictor

### Presentation Overview
With the power of AI, score/stats history and recent news my goal is to give the most likely outcome of a sports game. 
This will be done using various integrated API's for the most recent data found. Of course these prediction's will not 
be 100% correct but a "more likely to happen" scenario. Data will be provided in the form of graphs and tables (more
than likely box score style table).
